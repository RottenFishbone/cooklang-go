## cooklang-go
This project aims to be a reimplementation of the original [Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/CookCLI) CLI, written in Go.  

I will be maintaing a project structure that allows for module imports from `pkg.dev.go` to enable Cooklang utilities such as parsing, printing, creation as a library.

##### Current State
At present, the parser works and passes all canonical tests listed [here](https://github.com/cooklang/spec/tree/fa9bc51515b3317da434cb2b5a4a6ac12257e60b/tests).
